# Inclusive Persona Extension

(English Edition / [日本語版](/ja/))

The **Inclusive Persona Extension** (hereafter referred to as "this tool") is a tool to facilitate the consideration of accessibility in the design process of websites and web applications.

When conducting UX design using User-Centered Design (UCD) / Human-Centered Design (HCD) methodologies, the target user is defined as a persona, but the unspoken common understanding within the project might be that the persona is usually a person with no disability. As a result, it's not uncommon for accessibility considerations to be left out of the design deliverables, even when the design process is user-centered.

This tool aims to add context (e.g., disabled, aged, used in mobile, etc.) to personas and, by looking at them together, promote awareness of accessibility within the project.

The original document is available on Google Slides. You can copy it to your Google Drive, or download it as a PowerPoint, PDF, or text file, as needed.

## How to Use

This tool contains eight different contexts, each of which is organized into a single sheet.

- Visual Disabilities (Blindness)
- Visual Disabilities (Low Vision)
- Color-Blindness / Grayscale Print
- Auditory Disabilities / In a public / Non-Native Speaker
- Motor Disabilities
- Cognitive / Learning Disabilities
- Aging
- Mobile

Each sheet consists of the following three elements: context, problem(s), and solution(s), based on the idea of pattern language.

- Context : Type of disability
- Problems : Barriers to using the Web
- Solutions

It is a good idea to place each sheet alongside the personas so that they can be referenced by project stakeholders at any time. Each sheet has a context icon with a blank circle. You can add an image of the persona or the persona's name to make it easier to see the connection between the persona and the context.

This tool is mainly intended for the following uses. I hope you will feel free to use it in your team or projects.

- As a requirement specification to refer back to at any time during UI design.
- As a cheat sheet for a walk-through from the perspective of people with disabilities during UI evaluation. 
- Also for accessibility workshops.
